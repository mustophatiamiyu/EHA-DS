# EHA Design System

## Overview

The eHA Design System is built and maintained by eHA designers and developers. It contains design principles, guidelines, and reusable components that help the team design and deliver great experiences across eHA's digital products and solutions.

This living system provides:

- **Design Principles** that guide our decision-making
- **Reusable Components** built with RSuite
- **Design Tokens** for consistent styling
- **Guidelines and Patterns** for common use cases
- **Accessibility Standards** to ensure inclusive experiences

---

## Design Principles

These principles are best practices which help us design and develop better solutions and make more informed decisions.

### Simplicity

Keep the design simple and avoid unnecessary complexity to enhance clarity and user understanding.

---

### Consistency

Maintain a consistent look and feel across the interface to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience.

---

### Hierarchy

Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through the content, emphasizing important elements and relationships.

---

### Readability

Ensure text is legible and easy to read by choosing appropriate fonts, sizes, and contrast ratios.

---

### Navigation

Design intuitive and user-friendly navigation to help users easily move through the interface and find what they need.

---

### Feedback

Provide immediate and informative feedback to users, acknowledging their actions and guiding them through the interface.

---

### Accessibility

Prioritize accessibility by designing interfaces that are usable by people of all abilities and disabilities.

**In Practice:**

---

### Scannability

Break up content into digestible chunks, use headings, and employ visual cues to make content easy to scan.

---

### Flexibility

Design for various screen sizes and devices to ensure a seamless user experience across different platforms.

---

### Visual Appeal

Create visually appealing designs that align with the brand and engage users positively.
